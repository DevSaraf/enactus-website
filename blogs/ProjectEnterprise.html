                <h1>The Difference Between a Project and an Enterprise (And Why It Matters)</h1>

                <p class="blog-meta">By Enactus MUJ | December 2025</p>

                <p>
                    Many students use the terms “project” and “enterprise”
                    interchangeably—but the difference is crucial.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Projects are short-term and often end when funding or deadlines
                    finish. Enterprises, however, are designed to generate income
                    and continue operating long-term.
                </p>

                <p>
                    At Enactus, students are encouraged to build enterprises
                    because lasting impact comes from continuity, scalability,
                    and ownership.
