        Many students use the terms “project” and “enterprise” interchangeably—but the difference between the two is crucial.

A project:

Is short-term

Ends when funding or deadlines end

Often depends on external support

An enterprise:

Is long-term and continuous

Generates its own income

Grows and scales over time

Most college initiatives are projects. They are designed to finish within a semester or academic year. Enterprises, on the other hand, are built to survive even after students graduate.

Enactus encourages students to think beyond grades and certificates. By building enterprises, students learn real-world skills like financial planning, customer validation, operations, and leadership.

This distinction matters because real impact comes from continuity. Enterprises don’t stop—they evolve, expand, and multiply their impact year after year.
