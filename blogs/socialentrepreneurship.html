            Social entrepreneurship is the practice of using innovative business models to solve social and
            environmental problems. Unlike traditional entrepreneurship, its primary goal is not profit, but creating
            sustainable impact while remaining financially viable. Social entrepreneurs identify gaps in society—such as
            lack of education, healthcare, or environmental sustainability—and design solutions that empower communities
            rather than depend on charity. By blending purpose with entrepreneurship, social entrepreneurship enables
            long-term change that is scalable, inclusive, and impactful.</p>
