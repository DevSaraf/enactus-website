                <h1>What Is Social Entrepreneurship?</h1>

                <p class="blog-meta">By Enactus MUJ | December 2025</p>

                <p>
                    Social entrepreneurship is the practice of using innovative
                    business models to solve social and environmental problems.
                    Unlike traditional entrepreneurship, the primary goal is impact,
                    not profit alone.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Social entrepreneurs identify gaps in society—such as lack of
                    education, healthcare, or sustainability—and design solutions
                    that empower communities instead of relying on charity.
                </p>

                <p>
                    By blending purpose with entrepreneurship, social ventures
                    create long-term, scalable, and financially sustainable impact.
