           At first glance, Enactus may look like just another college club. But in reality, Enactus is a global platform for social entrepreneurship operating in over 30 countries and thousands of universities.

Enactus connects students, academic institutions, and business leaders with one shared goal: using entrepreneurial action to improve lives and shape a better world.

What makes Enactus different from typical college clubs?

Projects are evaluated by global business leaders

Solutions focus on enterprise creation, not activities

Students work on real-world problems with measurable impact

Enactus competitions are not about presentations alone—they are about real impact backed by real data. Students gain exposure to corporate mentors, leadership training, and global standards of entrepreneurship.

So no, Enactus is not just a college club. It is a global movement that prepares students to become responsible leaders, social entrepreneurs, and change-makers.</p>
