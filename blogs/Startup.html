                <h1>Why Most Student Startup Ideas Don’t Actually Solve Real Problems</h1>

                <p class="blog-meta">By Enactus MUJ | December 2025</p>

                <p>
                    Many student startup ideas begin with excitement—but fail to create real impact.
                    The most common reason is that they are idea-first, not problem-first.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Students often focus on what sounds innovative, what looks good in competitions,
                    or what can be built quickly—without deeply understanding who faces the problem daily,
                    why it exists, and what solutions people will actually use.
                </p>

                <p>
                    At Enactus, students are taught to begin with problem research—field visits,
                    interviews, and community feedback. Solutions are built with communities,
                    not for them.
                </p>

                <p>
                    When startups focus on real problems, they stop being academic exercises
                    and start becoming real enterprises with measurable impact.
