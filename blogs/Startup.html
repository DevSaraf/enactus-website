        <p style="font-size:18px; line-height:1.8;">
            Many student startup ideas begin with excitement—but fail to create real impact. The most common reason is that they are idea-first, not problem-first.

Students often focus on:

What sounds innovative

What looks good in competitions

What can be built quickly

Instead of asking:

Who is facing this problem daily?

Why does the problem exist?

What solution will people actually use and pay for?
Without understanding the real users and their needs, even the most creative ideas fail.

At Enactus, students are taught to start with deep problem research—field visits, surveys, interviews, and feedback loops. Solutions are built with communities, not for them.

When startups focus on real problems, they stop being academic exercises and start becoming real enterprises with measurable impact.
