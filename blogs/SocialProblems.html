        <p style="font-size:18px; line-height:1.8;">
            India faces several deep-rooted social problems—unemployment, waste management, lack of access to clean water, poor sanitation, and unequal education. While awareness campaigns and charity initiatives play an important role, many of these problems continue to exist despite decades of effort. The reason is simple: awareness alone does not scale, but business models do.

Take waste management as an example. Clean-up drives can temporarily improve an area, but without a system that incentivizes segregation, recycling, and reuse, the waste problem returns. A business-driven approach—where waste is converted into value through recycling, upcycling, or energy generation—creates income while solving the problem sustainably.

Similarly, unemployment cannot be solved only through skill workshops or donations. What truly creates long-term change is enterprise creation—businesses that generate employment, empower communities, and continue operating without constant external funding.

This is where social entrepreneurship becomes critical. Business solutions bring:

Financial sustainability

Scalability across regions

Accountability and efficiency

At Enactus, students learn that real impact happens when social good is combined with entrepreneurial thinking. By building enterprises instead of one-time initiatives, students can create solutions that last far beyond college.</p>
