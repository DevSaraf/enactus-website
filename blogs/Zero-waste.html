                <h1>How Can College Students Live a Zero-Waste Lifestyle on Campus Without Spending More?</h1>

                <p class="blog-meta">By Enactus MUJ | December 2025</p>

                <p>
                    Sustainability often feels expensive, especially for college students.
                    But living a zero-waste lifestyle does not require costly eco-friendly products—
                    it requires small behavioral changes.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Simple campus-friendly practices include carrying reusable bottles,
                    reducing hostel food waste, sharing resources, using digital notes,
                    and practicing waste segregation.
                </p>

                <p>
                    A zero-waste campus is built through collective action, consistency,
                    and conscious choices—not money.
                </p>
