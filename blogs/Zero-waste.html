        <p style="font-size:18px; line-height:1.8;">
           Sustainability often feels expensive, especially for college students. But living a zero-waste lifestyle does not require costly eco-friendly products—it requires small behavioral changes.

Simple campus-friendly practices include:

Carrying reusable bottles and containers

Reducing hostel food waste

Sharing books, notes, and supplies

Using digital notes instead of printing

Practicing waste segregation

The biggest waste problem is not lack of resources—it is lack of awareness and habits.

Enactus promotes sustainability that is accessible and affordable. By focusing on behavior change instead of expensive alternatives, students can reduce waste without increasing expenses.

A zero-waste campus is built through collective action, consistency, and conscious choices—not money.
