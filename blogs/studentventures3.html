                Some of the most impactful social innovations have come from
                student-led startups. These ventures often begin as small
                college projects but grow into scalable solutions addressing
                education, healthcare, sustainability, and employment.

                Students bring fresh perspectives, creativity, and a strong
                sense of purpose, allowing them to challenge traditional systems
                effectively. Student-led startups prove that age or experience
                is not a barrier to creating impact.
