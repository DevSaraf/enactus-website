            Some of the most impactful social innovations have come from student-led startups. These ventures often
            begin as small college projects but grow into scalable solutions addressing education, healthcare,
            sustainability, and employment. Students bring fresh perspectives, creativity, and a strong sense of
            purpose, allowing them to challenge traditional systems effectively.

            Student-led startups prove that age or experience is not a barrier to creating impact. With the right
            guidance, teamwork, and intent, students can build solutions that positively influence communities. These
            examples inspire others to believe that meaningful change can start within college campuses and expand far
            beyond them.
